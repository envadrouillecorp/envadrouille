EnVadrouille is a fast and powerful photo gallery that works without an SQL database. It does not even require PHP, once it has been set up. Live demo: http://envadrouille.org

As other photo galleries, EnVadrouille displays pictures. But it also has more cool features, EnVadrouille:
* Displays videos (ogv, mp4)
* Displays GPX traces and displays statistics on your trips (elevation, speed)!
* Does face recognition (optional)
* Supports themes! (Contribute by creating your own!)
* Supports languages! (Shipped with English and French; contribute by adding new translations!)
* No configuration file to edit. It just works. 

Also, unlike many other photo galleries:
* It is fast. No PHP is involved when a visitor browses your galleries.
* It works with DownThemAll. Right click -> DownThemAll will download all _original_ pictures of the gallery.
* Visitors have access to the original photos (EnVadrouille displays 900px thumbnails by default but the visitors can see original pictures if they want to).
* Previous and next button of your browser will work. Previous will not send you back to a page you browsed 30 minutes ago.


See README.html for details on how to install EnVadrouille and create galleries.
